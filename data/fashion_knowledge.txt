Fashion Color Wheel: The fashion color wheel is a vital tool for creating combinations. Complementary colors are directly opposite on the wheel (blue/orange, purple/yellow). Analogous colors sit next to each other. Triadic colors are evenly spaced. Monochromatic outfits use different shades of the same color.

Dress Codes Explained: Business formal requires suits and ties for men, suits or dresses for women. Business casual means slacks, button-downs, blouses, and no jeans or sneakers. Smart casual allows dark jeans and neat tops. Casual means comfortable clothing that's still presentable.

Seasonal Color Analysis: Winter types look best in clear, bright colors and strong contrasts. Summer types suit muted, soft colors. Autumn types look best in warm, earthy tones. Spring types suit clear, warm colors with yellow undertones.

Body Shape Guide: Apple shapes carry weight in the middle, should highlight legs. Pear shapes have wider hips than shoulders, should balance with volume on top. Hourglass shapes have balanced shoulders and hips with defined waists, should highlight the waist. Rectangle shapes have similar measurements throughout, should create curves with clothing.

Classic Wardrobe Essentials: Every wardrobe should include: white button-down shirt, well-fitting jeans, blazer, little black dress, neutral pumps or loafers, white sneakers, tailored pants, cardigan, and a quality t-shirt.

Fabric Care Guide: Cotton is machine washable and breathable. Silk requires dry cleaning or hand washing. Wool needs gentle washing and air drying. Polyester is durable and often machine washable. Linen wrinkles easily but is breathable and machine washable.

Pattern Mixing Rules: Scale is crucial - pair small patterns with large ones. Keep color families consistent when mixing patterns. Treat stripes as a neutral. Don't mix more than three patterns. Separate mixed patterns with solid colors.

Fashion Sustainability: Sustainable fashion focuses on environmentally friendly materials, ethical manufacturing, durability, and circular economy principles. Look for organic cotton, recycled materials, and brands with transparent supply chains.

Accessorizing Basics: The rule of three suggests wearing no more than three significant accessories at once. Remove one accessory before leaving the house. Scale accessories to your body size - smaller frames suit daintier pieces.

Layering Techniques: Start with thin, fitted layers closest to the body. Add structure with middle layers. Finish with the bulkiest outer layer. Vary lengths for visual interest. Consider texture contrast between layers.

Proportions Rule: Balance fitted and loose elements - pair a loose top with fitted bottoms or vice versa. The rule of thirds divides outfits into more flattering proportions than halves (1/3 top, 2/3 bottom or 2/3 top, 1/3 bottom).

Shoe and Hem Pairings: Ankle boots pair well with cropped pants and midi skirts. Knee-high boots work with mini skirts and dresses. Ballet flats complement cropped pants and midi skirts. Pointed heels elongate legs with any hem.

Occasion-Based Dressing: Wedding guest attire varies by time and formality - daytime events allow lighter colors, evening events require darker tones. Job interviews typically require business professional unless specified otherwise. First dates benefit from comfortable yet polished looks that represent your personality.

Fashion Era Influences: 1920s brought drop waists and art deco. 1950s featured full skirts and fitted waists. 1970s introduced bohemian and disco styles. 1980s had power suits and bold colors. 1990s featured minimalism and grunge. Y2K emphasized low-rise pants and logomania.

Face Shape and Necklines: Round faces suit V-necks and open collars. Square faces look best with round and scoop necks. Heart-shaped faces pair with boat necks. Oval faces work with almost any neckline.

Denim Guide: Skinny jeans suit most body types but especially show off slim legs. Straight leg jeans flatter rectangle shapes. Bootcut balances curvy figures. Wide-leg suits tall frames and creates curves. High-waisted jeans highlight the waistline.

Statement Piece Rule: Build outfits around one statement piece, keeping other elements more subdued. If wearing a bold printed top, opt for neutral bottoms. Statement jewelry works best against simple backgrounds.

Cultural Fashion Influences: Japanese minimalism emphasizes clean lines and quality materials. French style focuses on well-fitting basics and subtle elegance. Scandinavian fashion combines functionality with simple aesthetics. Italian fashion emphasizes craftsmanship and bold femininity or masculinity.

Climate Dressing: Hot weather calls for natural fibers like cotton, linen, and silk. Cold weather requires layers, starting with thermal base layers, adding insulating middle layers, and finishing with protective outer layers. Transitional weather benefits from removable layers.

Fashion and Age: Style evolves rather than being age-restricted. Focus on fit rather than trends as you age. Quality becomes more important than quantity. Personal style solidifies with age. Adapt trends to suit your personal style rather than following them exactly.
